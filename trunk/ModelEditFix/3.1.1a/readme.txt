WoWModelEdit 2.4.2 (Patch 3.1.1b)
by kynox

Usage:

I've decided to remove the old WoWMe. You no longer need a .cfg file, from now on it will be a standalone application.

As per usual, all edits must be in patch-X.MPQ(MPQ MUST BE IN CAPS) prefix.

1) Run WoW with WoWME.exe
2) Once you reach the login screen, hit F8 to restore changes
3) Login
4) Have fun
