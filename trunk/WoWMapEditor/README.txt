WoWMapEditor

This is a BETA program for editing .adt and .wmo files that you will find in the World fo Warcraft .MPQ files.
.ADT files are usually found in World/Maps/~
.WMO files are usually found in World/wmo/~

--------------------------------------------------

While this program can be used for exploration among many other fun 
things, it unfortunately can also be used for exploitation.  Recognizing this, I 
have limited this program from editing Battle Ground maps.  These maps 
alone however are obviously not the only ones that can be edited to give a 
user an unfair advantage in the game...

I ask that you please refrain from taking advantage, keep in mind you are 
NOT the only one with this program.  And should you among many other 
start using this application to cheat Blizzard will obviously nerf map editing.  
Yes, they can do it, and they haven't done it yet because it's not higher in 
priority as taking care of other exploits, SO LETS KEEP IT THAT WAY!!!!

If you think additional maps should be black-listed please say so on the 
mini-forum on the website.
